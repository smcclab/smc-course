title: "Week 6: interfaces"
summary: Building interfaces for musical expression
show_toc: true
---

You've implicitly been building interfaces every week (every Pd patch is an
interface, and so is even a piece of live code that you interact with during a
performance). The field of _New Interfaces for Musical Expression_ (NIME) is a
whole thing with its [own conference and everything](https://www.nime.org).

This week we'll think more specifically about what it means to design a good
interface for a LENS instrument. In computing more generally, interface design
(or UX, or Human-Computer Interaction) is a topic which many people have thought
a lot about over many years. There's even a
[course you can take](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/COMP3900) on
the subject.

Building on last week's [networks & collaboration workshop]({% link
_workshops/05-networks-collaboration.md %}), we'll think about how to control the
computer music systems we've been building through interfaces of various types. You've
already been doing this from your very first audiovisual diary entry, and most of
you have explored Pd's various bang/toggle/slider/radio/etc. objects. You can absolutely
build an interface with those things, but this week you'll need to think more deeply
about what it actually means to design an interface for your patches.

**Solo AVD**: pick
[someone else's patch/code from a previous workshop](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/laptop-ensemble/2021/2021-av-diary-materials),
put a new interface on it, and play something

**Note**: the "start with someone else's work" aspect of this week's provocation
is super important; you shouldn't have to spend any time this week doing the
actual "sound generation" work, you should be exclusively thinking about new
ways of controlling the noisemaking infrastructure that's already there.

## Goals for this week

1. experiment with new ways of controlling your sound

2. think about what it means to make a **n**ew **i**nterface for **m**usical
   _**e**xpression_

## Resources

- like last week, the
  [`3-new-interfaces` folder in the ComputerMusicIntro project](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/ComputerMusicIntro)
  has some cool patches for getting started with OSC, MIDI, etc.

- if you've got a smartphone, there are a bunch of configurable OSC apps which
  (combined with your knowledge from last week) you can probably turn into an
  interface if you like

- for a wild & wonderful tour of what's possible in the world of NIMEs, you can
  check out the [NIME community website](https://www.nime.org), including the
  [full archive of papers submitted to the NIME conference](https://www.nime.org/archives/)

## Things to think about

- what is an interface, exactly? thinking back over your previous Pd work (e.g.
  your AV Diary submissions), is each part of your patch equally "interface-y"?
  or are some parts of the patch more "interface-y" than others? was that a
  deliberate choice, or did it just work out that way?

- can computer programs be interfaces? what does the "I" in API stand for?

- imagine you're not going to be the one playing your instrument/interface...
  what does _expression_ or _virtuosity_ look like? how have you tried to design
  for a low floor (easy to get started) and/or high ceiling (lots of room for
  mastery)? or do you have other design priorities?

- since you're starting with someone else's work, think about what _they_ might
  consider their patch's interface to be? can you do something with their patch
  which might really surprise them?
