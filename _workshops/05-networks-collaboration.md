**Group AVD**: create a 3min piece where every member controls a different
aspect of the sound (note the longer duration for group AVDs)

{:.info-box}

This is the first **group AV diary** (although you've been making music together
in the ad-hoc workshop ensembles since week 2). As usual, we'll [spin the
wheel]({% link _lectures/group-picker-wheel.md %}) to assign people into groups
during the [week 4 workshop]({% link _workshops/04-envelopes-note-structure.md
%}).

In this week's workshop session we're looking at **networks & collaboration**.
We've already been collaborating together (every week!) but only by sending all
the individual audio streams to the mixing desk---not by communicating directly
between laptops.

Network connections are used to connect musicians together from different
locations, to connect devices together in one studio, and to connect different
pieces of software on one computer. This week you'll explore how to use networks
for collaboration in your laptop music making.

One important concept is the that in terms of what you might send over the
network, most data streams can be considered either "control" data or "signal"
data. This
[distinction is present in Pd](http://www.pd-tutorial.com/english/ch02.html#id409690),
with the `~` suffix on signal objects and the "thin" vs "thick" cables. These
different types of data streams require different tradeoffs (and therefore
different tools) when sending them over the network, so this week's
[Resources](#pd-resources) section has subsections for each type of data stream.

## Goals for this week

1. explore the history (and present) of networked music to see what artists have
   been doing when they're connected together, and find out about systems for
   sending musical data over networks

2. reflect on the affordances of the technology you're using in this course for
   computer music collaboration (both Pd specifically, and the socio-technical
   assemblage that is a bunch of humans with laptops and internet connections
   more generally)

3. with your group, design and carry out a collaboration workflow which allows
   you to deliver a **3min** AV diary entry by the week 5 workshop slot

## Pd Resources {#pd-resources}

- Charles' 2020
  [presentation on network music making](https://youtu.be/1J7EAu5g5zw)

- [Network Music (Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music)](https://www-cambridge-org.virtual.anu.edu.au/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C2A04A1DAE6EDE05909CF97DFEAD8B86/9781316459874c8_p138-153_CBO.pdf/network_music.pdf)

- the
  [`3-new-interfaces` folder in the ComputerMusicIntro project](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/ComputerMusicIntro)
  has some cool patches for getting started with OSC, MIDI, etc.

### Control data: Open Sound Control (OSC) & Midi

[OSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) is a great way to send
control messages between different audio programming environments.

Here are a couple of YouTube videos which explain things further:

- Andrew Johnston's
  [Pure Data and Open Sound Control](https://youtu.be/TTd57stEr_g)

- cheetomoskeeto's
  [Pure Data: 23 Open Sound Control 1](https://youtu.be/rxHIJx-O3iU)

For example code, look at the `3-new-interfaces/5-OSC-in-pd.pd` patch in the
example repo.

Pd didn't have OSC built in until fairly recently (v0.46), look at the
`oscformat` and `oscparse` objects which need `netsend` and `netreceive` to
work. Older videos will show how to import special libraries for OSC---not
needed anymore!

[MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) is the other main standard for this
stuff, which is a bit older & less flexible, but it's supported by _every_ piece
of musical hardware under the sun.

For example code, look at the `3-new-interfaces/1-MIDI-in-pd.pd` patch in the
example repo.

### Signal data: sending audio over the network

If you want to send audio signal data (i.e. a stream of bits that's meant to be
interpreted as an audio signal and sent to a DAC at some stage) then there are
few different options as well.

- [SonoBus](https://sonobus.net) is an easy to use application for streaming
  high-quality, low-latency peer-to-peer audio between devices over the internet
  or a local network. I (Ben) haven't used it myself yet---I only found out
  about it earlier this year---but it looks useful.

- [JackTrip](https://www.jacktrip.org) is a bunch of tools for live performance
  of music over the internet, including the
  [JackTrip audio conference server](https://youtu.be/wcyqRHYo-xo) and
  instructions on a
  [remote setup for Live Music Performance using Jacktrip & Aseqnet](https://youtu.be/duoCM70vQ44)

- The [Mumble open source voice chat server](https://www.mumble.info) is fairly
  easy to set up for doing live audio linkups with a number of people, but we
  don't know how well it might work for music. It's designed for voice, so the
  quality might limit what we can do with it.

- [JamRTC](https://github.com/lminiero/jamrtc) (pre-alpha) is an attempt to
  create a simple prototype for doing jam sessions using WebRTC.

Remember that your [first AV Diary portfolio]({% link
_assessments/01-audiovisual-diary.md %}#portfolio) is due at the end of this week.

## Things to think about

- how is your group going to meet & chat? if it's going to be online, then you
  should get it set up for your first discussion ASAP---if you need us to create
  a separate Teams channel for you then just ask

- which parts of the collaborative workflow need to be synchronous, and which
  parts could be async? do you want to collaborate sequentially, or in parallel?

- have a look at collaborative "parlour games" like
  [layer tennis](https://www.layertennis.com) or
  [exquisite corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse)---can you
  think of ways to adapt them for a LENS context?

- what's the collaborative songwriting process of your favourite bands (or art
  collectives), and are there ideas you can poach from them?

- what does networked music even mean? did it exist before computers? when
  looking for famous examples, how far back can you go? if you find anything
  cool, drop a link in the #inspo channel on Teams

- remember that you can send control messages over the network, or audio, or
  both, or a signal that's somewhere in between, or something else entirely---be
  creative!

- think about the specific network music context you're dealing with; is it lots
  of musicians in the same room connected via ethernet to the LAN, or is it a
  couple of musicians on opposite sides of the globe trying to improvise
  together in real-time? Can you design your piece to minimise the challenges or
  emphasise the opportunities provided by this specific networked context?
