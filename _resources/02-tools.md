### Laptop

LENS is a laptop ensemble, so if you have your own laptop and want to use that,
then that's great. During classes (e.g. the [workshop sessions]({% link
_workshops/index.md %})) we expect you to bring your laptop (and charger), and
some headphones.

If you don't have a laptop you can use, then [let Ben
know](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au). We want this class to be accessible to
everyone, so if the "BYO laptop" thing is an issue we'll try our best to help
you out with a loaner laptop for the semester.

We also have a limited number of
[headphones](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/2d52765b7d84656c/index.html),
[audio
interfaces](https://www.behringer.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Interfaces/UM2/)),
and [MIDI controllers](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/novation-impulse-49)
for LENS students to use in class or borrow if you need to. Let us know if you
have a good use case for these!

### Computer music software {#software}

Learning the basics of computer music programming is a core part of this course.
There are two primary computer music software environments we'll use in the LENS
course [Pure Data (Pd)](https://puredata.info) and
[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io).

##### Pure Data (Pd) {#pure-data}

{:.info-box}

We'll be installing & using Pd on our laptops from week 1, so if you want to get
a head start you could even download & install it now.

Pd is a visual computer music environment. It's just a regular piece of software
which runs on your computer, although there are also versions which run on
Android/iOS phones and tablets and even on Raspberry Pi!

Pd is freely available and works on Windows, macOS & Linux. To install it, go to
the [Pd downloads page](https://puredata.info/downloads) and get the latest
version of "vanilla" Pd for your platform (as shown in the screenshot).

![download box on the Pd website]({% link assets/resources/pd-download-box.png %})

###### Example code/patches

- All of the built-in Pd objects come with an example patch which explains how
  to use them. You can access this help browser using the `Help > Browser...`
  menu.

- Charles has written a series of introductory examples to Pure Data:
  [ComputerMusicIntro
  examples](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/ComputerMusicIntro)

- You can also find lots of great Pd examples in the [rjlib
  library](https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib/)

###### Books

- _Kreidler, J._ [Programming Electronic Music in
  Pd](http://www.pd-tutorial.com) (2013). This book is freely available online,
  and is a good "from the ground up" introduction to how to make music in Pd.
  Some of the screenshots are a bit out of date, but since Pd hasn't changed
  very much since it was written the actual content is still quite current and
  useful.

- _Puckette, M._ [Theory and Technique of Electronic
  Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm) (2007). This is a book by the
  creator of Pd, and even though it uses Pd for all the examples it's really a
  more general book about how computer music works. It covers a bunch of the
  mathematical & signal processing foundations of the techniques you'll learn in
  the course, and if you're into that sort of thing then you might enjoy this
  book. However, in this course understanding the maths is less important than
  understanding the use of these thins in a LENS context, so we won't cover the
  more maths-y stuff in this course.

- [Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music](https://www-cambridge-org.virtual.anu.edu.au/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-electronic-music/51F366EA55DAE2CBCCB191E2D8349C9F) (available through ANU library online). A great resource that covers all the concepts in this course with chapters written by current computer music composers and researchers.


##### Extempore {#extempore}

{:.info-box}

We'll be installing & using Extempore on our laptops from week 3, but
again---there's nothing stopping you getting started sooner!

[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io) is a text-based computer music
environment (partly developed by [Ben](https://benswift.me) & others at ANU!).
You might have seen Ben use it in his
[livecoding](https://benswift.me/livecoding/), but you can use it for "offline"
music-making as well.

###### Books

If you're new to Extempore, start with the
[Quickstart](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/overview/quickstart/) page in
Extempore's online documentation, which includes instructions on how to install
it on your laptop. Like Pd, Extempore is free & works on Windows, macOS & Linux.

###### Example code

As far as example code goes, Extempore comes with a bunch of example code (it's
in the `examples/` folder). One cool place to start is the
`examples/sharedsystem` folder. You can also read around the Extempore
documentation website, (for example to learn to make music with the [Extempore
pattern
language](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/guides/pattern-language/)).

##### Screen recording software {#screen-recording-software}

Recording videos of your work is a crucial part of this course, you'll be doing
it every week for your [AV diary submission]({% link
_deliverables/01-audiovisual-diary.md %}#weekly-videos).

In this course you get to decide which screen recording software you'll use, as
long as it produces videos in a format which can be processed by
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

Here are a few suggestions:

- [OBS](https://obsproject.com) (free, macOS/Windows/Linux)
- [QuickTime
  Player](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac)
  (free, macOS only)
- [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) (paid, macOS/Windows)
- [Screenflow](Screenflow) (paid, macOS only)

A few more tips:

1. Some of these tools also have basic video editing features---which you'll
   probably need if you want to trim your videos to time, cut & stitch separate
   parts of the video together, etc. However, OBS doesn't really do that, so if
   you want to use OBS (which is great at what it does) you'll need something to
   edit the videos as well.

2. When you're recording, make sure it's capturing the direct audio output as
   well (which can sometimes be a bit tricky). With OBS on macOS, this can be
   tricky---you might need to use something like
   [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) to route the audio
   into OBS so that it records properly.

### Hardware {#hardware}

{:.info-box}

You don't _need_ to buy anything to take this course, but if you _want_ to buy
something, we understand, computer music gear is _fun!_

Here are a few things you might like to look at:

- Some **nice headphones**. You can get _great_ headphones from between
  $50-$150, for a cheaper option we like [Audio
  Technica](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/2d52765b7d84656c/index.html)
  and for a more expensive option, have a look at [Sony
  MDR-7506](https://www.storedj.com.au/sony-mdr-7506-stereo-professional-monitoring-headphones)
  or [BeyerDynamic DT770
  pro](https://www.storedj.com.au/search?ProductSearch=BEY-DT770PRO8).

- An **audio interface** for your laptop. If you only need two outputs, you
  might be fine with the headphone output on your laptop. External audio
  interfaces connect to your computer over USB and give you more audio inputs
  and outputs with higher quality sound and more (physical) connector options.
  They sometimes have better audio drivers and provide a smoother audio
  experience (particularly in Windows). There are lots of great audio interfaces
  with 2 microphone inputs and 2 line outputs for about $200 (e.g., [PreSonus
  AudioBox
  USB96](https://www.storedj.com.au/presonus-audiobox-usb96-audio-and-midi-interface-w-studio-one-artist-and-studio-magic-black)).
  You can get more expensive interfaces if you want that have more [inputs and
  outputs](https://www.storedj.com.au/presonus-studio-1824c-18x20-192khz-usb-c-audio-interface-w-studio-one-artist-daw)
  if you want, but these are more useful if you're setting up a small studio,
  not for laptop ensemble :-)

- A **hardware MIDI Controller**. It's often more fun to control music with
  your hands rather than with a keyboard and mouse (unless you're a live coder)!
  We like the [Korg
  NanoKontrol](https://www.storedj.com.au/search?ProductSearch=KOR-NANOKONT2BK)
  which gives you some knobs and sliders for about $100 and works nicely with Pd
  or Extempore. The [Akai
  LPD8](https://www.storedj.com.au/akai-lpd8-ultra-portable-pad-controller-w-8-pads)
  gives you knobs and pads, but not sliders.
  
Here's what's not required for this class:
  
- **Expensive synthesisers, Ableton Live, Eurorack systems, etc.** Well all of this stuff is awesome and fun, but you can do a lot of learning and music making with just a laptop and a pair of headphones so stick with those for the moment!

### Other books {#other-books}

There are other computer music languages & software packages as well, and you're
always welcome to mess around with whatever creative tools you like. However,
for the LENS curriculum we'll cover those two, and you're also expected to use
one or the other as the foundation for your final [LENS performance]({% link
_deliverables/03-lens-performance.md %}). Still, if you're keen to explore
further here area a few good options.
