## Sound and Music Computing

two big goals:

1. make _sound_ with _code_ on laptop _computers_

2. play computer _music_ in a group

...how do we do this at ANU?

## how does this work?

1. get logged in on your computer (need temporary user ID and password)

2. open "Chromium" web browser

3. go to <https://bit.ly/laptop-music-coding> for the workshop instructions

4. go to <https://gibber.cc> to start coding music

see these slides: <https://bit.ly/coding-music-slides>

⚠️⚠️ the lab computers use an operating system called _linux_ that you might not be familiar with! You might need help finding _Chromium_ and the _volume control_. ⚠️⚠️

## Gibber

![]({% link assets/lectures/gibber-screen.png %}){: style="width:70%;float:right;"}

Free tool for making computer music---in your web browser.

Developed by [Charlie Roberts](https://charlie-roberts.com). "New" (circa 2013), under _active_ development.

Start using it at [gibber.cc](https://gibber.cc).

## Later... so you've made a piece in Gibber...

1. Dive deeper into the synth designs provided in Gibber (well, in [gibberish](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibberish/tree/v3/js/instruments) actually, see below). Create sounds with a synth you haven't used before such as `fm` or `karplusstrong`.

2. Read through the [`modulation` tutorial](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber/blob/main/playground/examples/modulation.js) and the [`arpeggios and signals as sequences` tutorial](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber/blob/main/playground/examples/arp.js) and learn about how to create custom modulations for synth parameters and sequences.

3. Look at the [`making synths` tutorial](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber/blob/main/playground/examples/make.js) and create your own synth design in Gibber using the Genish DSP library.

5. Try the `tidalcycles` tutorial for a different (some would say better) way of defining sequences in Gibber. The full syntax for tidalcycles mininotation is [here](http://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mini_notation/).

4. Use Gibber's built-in collaboration features to create a group performance with your ensemble!

## Much later... music and code resources

0. ANU Sound and Music Computing [student performances.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EdxJ_aJRHA&list=PLKm3iGh1D7Mur62hvm6BHBNqlObABGDgY)
1. The [gibber playground](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber): Gibber's user interface, clone this repo to run Gibber locally.
2. [gibber.audio.lib](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.audio.lib): Audio components for Gibber, most of this wraps `gibberish` (see below), but it does include the [presets](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.audio.lib/tree/main/js/presets).
3. [gibber.graphics.lib](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.graphics.lib): Graphics components for Gibber.
4. [gibber.core.lib](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.core.lib): A few shared objects and function for Gibber, mostly for sequencing. `euclid`, `seq`, and `tidal` are defined here.
5. [gibberish](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibberish): a "fast JavaScript DSP library". If you want to know where `Synth` or `Sampler` are defined, look here (actually look in `gibberish/js/instruments`).
6. [genish](https://github.com/charlieroberts/genish.js): this is a lower-level DSP library for doing "per-sample audio processing" (inspired by the `gen~` object from Max/MSP). To understand why this is cool, look at the [genish tutorial](http://www.charlie-roberts.com/genish/tutorial/index.html).
